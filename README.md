üìù Comments:

I wanted to do something more "mine", more personal. Something different to add in my portfolio.
Then I had the idea of doing a small e-commerce shop. I started this on pen and paper, scribbling the design of the page and then starting to code it. This has been quite a challenge, I has taken a little bit more time that I expected, faced a lot of unknown things and learnt a lot thanks to that and reading documentation.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Extras:

- The shop is called "shopper" because is a mix of "Chopper" and "Shop". Chopper is my favourite character from a anime series called "One Piece". That is why I also designed a pink hat with a white cross on top of the name of the shop. This hat is Chopper's first hat. This is also why my website has a lot of pink and beige colour: he is a reindeer with a pink hat.

- In the address section, there is the following address: "Gumdrop House, Lollipop Lane, Happy-Land". This is from "The Simpsons" series. This is a quote of Homer Simpson, when he is being sarcastic. He says: "I'm making people happy! I'm the magical man from Happyland in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Lane! Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic." I found it very funny and decided to add this as an address.
